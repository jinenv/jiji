# JIJI

This project implements a **real-time, stateful Discord bot** with RPG and gacha mechanics. It is designed for **scalability**, **atomic state transitions**, and **strict separation of concerns**.

## 📦 Stack Overview

| Layer         | Technology                           |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| Bot API      | [Disnake](https://docs.disnake.dev/) (`>=2.9.0`)         |
| Database     | PostgreSQL + [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/) + [asyncpg](https://magicstack.github.io/asyncpg/current/) |
| Migrations   | [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/) (`>=1.13.0`) |
| Caching      | [Redis (Upstash)](https://upstash.com/) via `redis.asyncio` |
| Config       | `dotenv`-based + `ConfigManager` (centralized loader) |
| Logging      | Dual-stream: ops + structured transactions |
| Runtime      | Python 3.12, fully async, Windows/Unix agnostic |

## 🧠 Architectural Principles

### Core Separation of Concerns
- **Pure Data Models**: SQLModel classes contain ONLY data fields, simple calculations, and display helpers
- **Business Logic in Services**: All complex operations, transactions, and workflows live in dedicated service classes
- **Thin Controllers**: Disnake Cogs are routing shells that call services; they contain no business logic
- **Atomic Operations**: All state changes use proper database transactions with rollback capabilities
- **Stateless Commands**: Discord commands always resolve full state at runtime from the database

### Service-Oriented Architecture
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles one domain (fusion, awakening, quests, etc.)
- **Dependency Injection**: Services use other services through clean interfaces
- **Cache Management**: Intelligent cache invalidation through dedicated CacheService
- **Transaction Logging**: All business events are logged for analytics and debugging
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses with user-friendly messages

### Infrastructure-Only Utils
- **Pure Functions**: Utils contain NO business logic, only infrastructure and data access
- **Configuration-Driven**: All game tuning parameters come from JSON/YAML via `ConfigManager`
- **Infrastructure Services**: Database, Redis, logging, and Discord API operations only
- **Data Access Utilities**: Pure functions for loading and structuring configuration data

## 🔄 Service Architecture

### Pure Data Models (Models contain ZERO business logic)
```python
# Models are pure data containers - ALL business logic removed
class Player(SQLModel):
    # Data fields only
    id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    discord_id: int = Field(sa_column=Column(BigInteger, unique=True, index=True))
    jijies: int = Field(default=0)
    
    # Simple calculations only
    def get_skill_bonuses(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
        return {"bonus_attack": self.allocated_skills.get("attack", 0) * 0.001}

# ALL business logic moved to services
class PlayerService(BaseService):
    @classmethod
    async def add_currency(cls, player_id: int, currency_type: str, amount: int, source: str):
        # Comprehensive currency workflow with transaction logging
```

### Complete Service Layer
All business logic is distributed across 23 specialized services:

| Service | Domain Responsibilities |
|---------|------------------------|
| **ability_service.py** | Ability resolution, validation, formatting, configuration |
| **achievement_service.py** | Achievement tracking, unlocking, progress calculation |

| **power_service.py** | Combat power calculations, total power caching |
| **progression_service.py** | Character progression, unlock conditions |
| **relic_service.py** | Relic operations, MW-style stat calculations, equipment |
| **resource_service.py** | Resource generation, regeneration, limits |
| **reward_service.py** | Reward distribution, processing, validation |
| **search_service.py** | Esprit filtering, sorting, random selection |
| **statistics_service.py** | Analytics, metrics, behavioral tracking |

## 🎮 Game System Architecture

### Monster Warlord-Inspired Design
- **Universal Stacks**: Each Esprit record represents ALL copies a player owns
- **Tier-Based Progression**: 18 tiers with exponential power scaling
- **Awakening System**: Star-based enhancement consuming duplicate copies
- **Fusion System**: Combine same-tier monsters with element-based results
- **Leader Bonuses**: Active leader provides element-specific bonuses
- **Fragment Economy**: Failed fusions/awakenings produce upgrade materials

### Service Transaction Patterns
All services follow consistent patterns:
- **Atomic Operations**: Complete success or complete rollback
- **Transaction Logging**: All business events captured for analytics
- **Cache Invalidation**: Immediate invalidation on state change
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with user context
- **Resource Locking**: SELECT FOR UPDATE on all state modifications

---

## 📊 Performance Architecture

### Caching Strategy
- **Player Power**: Cache total combat stats (15min TTL)
- **Leader Bonuses**: Cache active leader effects (30min TTL)
- **Collection Stats**: Cache progress data (15min TTL)
- **Leaderboards**: Cache ranking data (5min TTL)

### Database Optimization
- **Connection Pooling**: Managed by asyncpg
- **Query Optimization**: Specific field selection, proper JOINs
- **Transaction Scope**: Minimal lock duration
- **Index Strategy**: Foreign keys and frequently queried fields

### Concurrency Safety
- **SELECT FOR UPDATE**: All state-modifying operations
- **Atomic Transactions**: Complete success or complete rollback
- **Cache Invalidation**: Immediate on state change
- **Distributed Locking**: Redis-based for cross-instance operations

- **Utils**: Pure infrastructure utilities with ALL business logic moved to services ✅
- **Architecture**: Complete separation of concerns with zero cross-contamination ✅
- **Transaction Patterns**: Consistent error handling, logging, and caching across all layers ✅

### New Services Created

### Utils Cleanup Summary
All utils are now **pure infrastructure** with **zero business logic**:

| Util | Purpose | Business Logic Moved To |
|------|---------|------------------------|
| **database_service.py** | ✅ Connection management | N/A (pure infrastructure) |
| **redis_service.py** | ✅ Cache operations | N/A (pure infrastructure) |
| **config_manager.py** | ✅ Configuration loading | N/A (pure infrastructure) |
| **transaction_logger.py** | ✅ Logging infrastructure | N/A (pure infrastructure) |
| **game_constants.py** | ✅ Constants, enums, EmbedColors | Complex calculations → Services |
| **embed_colors.py** | ✅ Color constants only | Color selection logic → DisplayService |
| **ability_system.py** | ✅ Data access only | Resolution logic → AbilityService |
| **relic_system.py** | ✅ Data access only | Operations → RelicService |
| **emoji_manager.py** | ✅ Discord API only | Business operations → DisplayService |

### Pending Implementation
- **Cogs**: All Discord command handlers need to be implemented using service calls
- **Service Integration**: Cross-service dependencies need to be established
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for service layer
- **Documentation**: Service API documentation and usage patterns

### Migration Requirements
All future cog implementations must use service calls exclusively:
```python
# REQUIRED PATTERN - services only
from src.services.fusion_service import FusionService
result = await FusionService.execute_fusion(player_id, esprit1_id, esprit2_id)

# FORBIDDEN PATTERN - direct model calls
# await esprit.perform_fusion(other_esprit, session)  # THIS WILL FAIL
```
